## What is it?

A routing library for serverless runtimes. It has a simple API and many unique features, including a built-in versioning system based on compatibiltiy dates.

## Why?

Other routing libraries can sometimes require a lot of boilerplate, or custom code to get them to work.

## The Solution

Comet aims to be as simple as possible, while still providing a lot of features.

Many of its features are implemented as middleware, and are intelligently disabled where not necessary to improve performance. Comet also has a built-in versioning system based on compatibility dates, which allows you to easily roll out new versions of your application without breaking existing clients.

## What is it?

Cloudflare Workers run on Cloudflare's JavaScript Runtime, workerd, which is different from Node.js. This means that the types for Node.js are not compatible with workerd. @cloudflare/workers-types provides type definitions for the Cloudflare Workers Runtime.

## What else is it?

I also maintain a website where these type definitions can be viewed online and referenced easily.

## Why?

Cloudflare Workers are a great way to host serverless applications. They run on their own runtime, so not everything is the same as in Node.js.

## The Solution

@cloudflare/workers-types provides type definitions for the Cloudflare Workers Runtime. This makes it easier to write TypeScript code that works on Cloudflare Workers.

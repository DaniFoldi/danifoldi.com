## What is it?

A cross-platform framework providing a consistent API for different Minecraft server platforms.

## Why?

Different Minecraft server platforms have different APIs for achieving the same thing. This makes it harder to write plugins that work on multiple platforms.

## The Solution

microbase provides a consistent API for different Minecraft server platforms. It also provides a set of utilities that make it easier to write plugins that work on multiple platforms.

Cloudflare recently announced [Workers AI](https://blog.cloudflare.com/best-place-region-earth-inference/), an API that allows users to run machine learning models on the edge. I decided to try it out by building a text-based adventure game, where the story is generated by Workers AI.

### The idea

You may remember the ComputerCraft mod from Minecraft which had a built-in text-based adventure game. My intention was to create something similar - a small game that can show the capabilities of the platform.

### The game

The story is generated by Llama 2, a text generation model available on Workers AI.

### The challenges

Games were boring. I solved this by seeding the context with a random number, which seems to have helped a lot. Stories are a lot more interesting and varied now.

Text-based games make ugly websites. Thanks to the NES.css library, I was able to improve the looks, to the point where it's actually pleasant to look at.

### Future improvements

I plan to iterate on the game, adding more features and improving the story generation.

Currently, the game is limited by the length of the model's input. Vectorize to the rescue!

The UI is also imperfect, and while I'm no designer, there is definitely some low-hanging fruit to be picked.

The interaction with the model is also not perfect. The detections for displaying certain bits of the interface can definitely be improved.
